# Gyrosurf

Gyrosurf web browser

This project aims to build a premium-looking and fully functional real-world web browser using JavaScript-based technologies.

The Windows, Mac, and Linux variants of the application are built using Chromium, Electron, and Node.js.  
The smartphone variant will be written using React Native.

### Technologies Used:
- Chromium
- Node.js
- ElectronJS
- C++ (for performance-critical parts)

This project demonstrates my ability to understand and develop software.
